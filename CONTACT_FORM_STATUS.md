# Portfolio Contact Form - Formspree Integration Status

## ✅ Current Status: Ready for Vercel Integration

Your contact form has been configured to work with the **Vercel-Formspree Integration**, which is the easiest and most automated approach.

### **✅ What's Implemented:**
- 🚀 **@formspree/react** package installed
- � **Contact form** updated to use Formspree hooks
- � **Environment variable** configured for `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM`
- ✅ **Form validation** with error handling
- 🎨 **Professional UI** with loading states and success messages
- 📋 **Documentation** for setup process

### **🚀 Next Step: Install Vercel Integration**

**Option 1: Vercel Integration (Recommended - 2 minutes):**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/integrations/formspree
2. Click "Add Integration"
3. Select your "portfolio" project
4. Follow the prompts
5. Done! The `NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM` environment variable will be set automatically

**Option 2: Manual Setup (Alternative):**
- Create form at https://formspree.io
- Get form ID from endpoint URL
- Add environment variable manually

### **🎯 How It Works:**
- **Code**: Uses `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_FORM` for form ID
- **Fallback**: Has placeholder for build process
- **Integration**: Vercel automatically sets environment variable
- **Deployment**: Next push will have working contact form

### **📧 What You'll Get:**
- Real email notifications when someone submits
- Spam protection and validation
- Submission dashboard in Formspree
- Professional email templates
- 50+ submissions/month on free plan

## Current Form Behavior:
