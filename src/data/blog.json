The same Docker Compose files, monitoring configurations, and network designs that power my home lab have been adapted for million-dollar client deployments.","coverImage":null,"author":{"name":"Henry Barefoot","avatar":null},"tags":["homelab","docker","infrastructure","monitoring","dns","automation"],"category":"Infrastructure","publishedAt":"2025-12-21T12:00:00.000Z","readingTime":5,"sourceWikiPage":"/en/homelab","codeSnippets":[],"businessContext":"This home lab infrastructure demonstrates enterprise-grade patterns that directly apply to business solutions across multiple industries.","industry":"DevOps"}],"meta":{"totalPosts":1,"categories":[{"name":"Infrastructure","slug":"infrastructure","description":"","count":1}],"tags":["homelab","docker","infrastructure","monitoring","dns","automation"],"lastUpdated":"2025-12-21T12:00:00.000Z"}}
